# My personal website 
### Url - http://mandev.net

This is the repository, where I built my personal website using the *Model–view–viewmodel* pattern. The libraries and tools I utilized were: 
- [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) as main framework;
- [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for package management;
- [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel) for deployment;
- [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) for scrolling and routing;
- [i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) for internationalization;
- [vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify) for material design;
- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass) for global variables; 
- [SpinKit](https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit) for the loader.
